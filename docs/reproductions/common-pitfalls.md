## 1. Rotation Conventions

**rot6d layout: interleaved vs contiguous**
- Two incompatible memory layouts for 6D rotation. Interleaved: `[r00, r10, r01, r11, r02, r12]`. Contiguous: `[r00, r10, r20, r01, r11, r21]`.
- Impact: X-VLA CALVIN 3.97→4.30 after fixing.
- Fix: Match the official codebase's rot6d encode/decode exactly.

**Euler vs axis-angle confusion**
- CALVIN robot_obs[3:6] is euler XYZ, not axis-angle. For small angles they're similar, masking the bug.
- Fix: Confirm the convention from the official eval code.

**Missing euler offset**
- Some models need a fixed offset (e.g., X-VLA SimplerEnv needs `[0, π/2, 0]`).
- Impact: 0% — all rotations in wrong frame.

**Quaternion convention (wxyz vs xyzw)**
- ManiSkill2 and `transforms3d` use wxyz. Most other libraries use xyzw. Inline index reordering is error-prone.
- Fix: Use explicit helpers (`quat_wxyz_to_xyzw`) instead of `q[1], q[2], q[3], q[0]`.

**Bridge rotation correction**
- GR00T SimplerEnv WidowX requires `quat_to_matrix(xyzw) @ default_rot.T → euler` to convert ManiSkill2 quaternions to Bridge convention. Google Robot requires wxyz→xyzw reorder without euler conversion.
- Fix: Compare state values numerically against the official `_process_observation`.

## 2. Gripper Mapping

**Threshold mismatch**
- Different codebases use different thresholds (0.5 vs 0.7 vs 0.8). Usually 1-5pp impact.

**Polarity inversion**
- Conventions differ: LIBERO +1=close/-1=open, CALVIN +1=open/-1=close, SimplerEnv WidowX +1=open/-1=close.
- Beware double-flip: if model server AND benchmark both flip, they cancel out.

**Sticky gripper (Google Robot)**
- Google Robot requires a 15-step "sticky" repeat mechanism for gripper actions. The model outputs relative gripper values that must be held for 15 steps when a significant change is detected.
- Impact: 0% on manipulation tasks without it.

## 3. State / Proprioception

**State not sent**
- Model expects state but receives zeros. X-VLA SimplerEnv: 0%. GR00T: ~25% vs 62%.

**Wrong state source**
- LIBERO has two sources: observation quaternion vs controller internal, differing by ~90°. X-VLA: 97.8%→42% with wrong source.

**eef_pos missing (NVIDIA fork)**
- GR00T requires EE-in-base-frame pose (`eef_pos`), which only exists in NVIDIA's internal ManiSkill2 fork. Official SimplerEnv has `base_pose` (robot base, not EE) — completely different data.
- Impact: ~0% without patch → 30-55% with patch.
- Fix: Patch `base_agent.py` + robot agent (`widowx.py`, `googlerobot.py`). Use try/except for backward compatibility.

**Gripper closedness formula**
- WidowX joint range is `[0.015, 0.037]`, not `[0, 0.037]`. Using the wrong range produces up to 0.4 error per timestep.
- Fix: Use `get_qlimits()` for actual range.

## 4. Action Format

**Dimension mismatch** — Model outputs 20D raw, benchmark expects 7D. Implement conversion in model server.

**Absolute vs delta mode** — Robot flies away if absolute positions are interpreted as deltas.

**Action type (qpos vs ee)** — RoboTwin supports both; sending EE as qpos = 0%.

**Unnormalization stat keys (min/max vs q01/q99)**
- Models may unnormalize actions using different statistic keys from the same stats file. starVLA LIBERO uses `min`/`max`; starVLA SimplerEnv uses `q01`/`q99` (1st/99th percentile). These give different scaling bounds.
- Impact: starVLA LIBERO 0% with q99 → functional with min/max.
- Detection: Check the reference eval's unnormalization function for which keys it reads.
- Fix: Add `unnorm_type` parameter (`minmax` vs `q99`).

## 5. Evaluation Protocol

**chunk_size / n_action_steps**
- Model predicts N actions; eval may use 1 (re-infer every step) or all N. The correct setting is benchmark-specific: GR00T SimplerEnv uses 1, GR00T LIBERO uses 16.
- Impact: GR00T WidowX 0% with 16 → ~30% with 1.

**max_episode_steps**
- X-VLA SimplerEnv: 0% with 120 steps, functional with 1200. Always match the official eval's budget.

**Termination semantics (cross-model comparability warning)**
- SimplerEnv has no standard success protocol. Two semantics are used on the **same** tasks:
  - **truncation**: run to max steps, success = `done` on the final step. Used by most models (starVLA, X-VLA, DB-CogACT — via the standard `maniskill2_evaluator.py`).
  - **accumulate**: run to max steps, success if `done=True` at **any** point during the episode. Used by GR00T (via `current_successes[env_idx] |= bool(env_success)` in vectorized rollout).
- The difference matters for tasks with **unstable success** — e.g., stacking a cube that can topple. A robot that stacks the cube at step 80 but knocks it off by step 120 scores 0% under truncation but 100% under accumulate. For stable placements (eggplant in deep basket), both give the same result.
- Impact: DB-CogACT Stack: 75% (accumulate) → 29% (truncation). **Published SimplerEnv scores across models are not directly comparable** unless the termination semantics match.
- This is an ecosystem-level issue: SimplerEnv itself does not prescribe a standard, and each codebase uses its own evaluation loop.

**Random vs deterministic episode placement**
- GR00T eggplant: 50% with deterministic placement vs 4% with random. Match the official protocol and use enough episodes (200+) for random.

## 6. Image Preprocessing

**Center crop** (OpenVLA, OpenVLA-OFT)
- Fine-tuned checkpoints trained with random crop augmentation (`crop_scale=0.9`). At eval time, center crop (area 90%, then resize back) must be applied.
- Isolated impact: ~3pp (OpenVLA LIBERO 73.3% → 76.4%).
- Reference: `openvla/experiments/robot/openvla_utils.py:crop_and_resize()`.
- Detection: check if reference config has `center_crop: true` or `image_aug` in checkpoint name.

## 7. Environment / Infra

**env.seed**
- Some references use a different seed for the environment (`env.seed()`) than for the global random state (`set_seed_everywhere()`). For example, the OpenVLA LIBERO reference uses `env.seed(0)` while setting the random seed to 7. The LIBERO `env.seed()` comment says it "seems to affect object positions even when using fixed initial state." Individual impact not measured.
- Detection: check the reference eval's environment setup for explicit `env.seed()` calls.

**Internal forks**
- Some codebases evaluate using forks with patches not in the public repos:
  - **NVIDIA GR00T**: uses `squarefk/SimplerEnv` + `youliangtan/ManiSkill2_real2sim` which add eef_pos proprioception, instruction wording changes, and new tasks.
  - **X-VLA**: uses `255isWhite/SimplerEnv` which patches ManiSkill2 for absolute EE control mode and sink camera alignment. Without these patches, X-VLA gets 0% on SimplerEnv.
- Reported scores from internal forks may not be reproducible on official SimplerEnv.
- Detection: Check if the official eval references a git submodule, specific fork URL, or custom Dockerfile.
